Hash Map:
HashMap - is a implementation class of a Map. Map is a collection of key value pair.

Initial buket size 16. Thrash hold value 12. By time it reach 12th size it resize it self.

Maintain a linked list node in data storing.

Node - Hash, Key, Value, Next(it keeps the address of other node).

HashMap<String, Integer> myHashMap = new HashMap<>();
	myHashMap.put("Physics", 34);
	myHashMap.put("Chemistry", 40);
	myHashMap.put("Math", 45);
					key, value

in storing values internally 'put' method is called,  in which a 'hashCode' function is called. Which is generating a hash value. which gives a index no where the values will go according to the index no, with a key and value it holds.
Hash Collision - If a new key value pair is added on the same index then a equalls operation is perform which check the keys are equal or not, if keys are equal then it will replace the value. Otherwise if key is different with a same index then that node is stored in the end node of the linked list.

HashMap comes in collection. It represent Hash Table data structure in key value pairs. Improce the search operation with help of keys through hashing. Complexitiy Ox1.

HashMap implements Arrays & Linked list.

HashMap is not thread safe.

Use of HashMap in a multiThread application - because multi threads can change the value of a object.
