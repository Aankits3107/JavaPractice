Exceptions
----------
Comes under throwable.
Throwable is not a interface but a class for exception handling.
It have two child classes - 1. Exception, 2, Error

                                                                Throwable
                                                        They are Partially Checked
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exception                                                                                                              Error
---------                                                                                                              -----
Exceptions are caused by code/program.                                                                                 Error are not caused by code/program.
Exceptions are recoverable (handling it).                                                                              Error are non-recoverable (can'r be handled ).
    use try catch.                                                                                                         Caused by lack of system resources. ie. not enough stack memory, network issue, VM error
Exceptions are partially checked, bcz its child classes few are checked few are unchecked.                             All errors are unchecked exceptions

RuntimeException                    IOException                 InterruptedException        RemoteException            VirtualMachineError        LinkageError    AssertionError      ExceptionInInitializerError

ClassCachedException
IndexOutOfBoundException
    ArrayIndexOutofBoundException
    StringIndexOutOfBoundException
IllegalArgumentException
    NumberFormatException



Checked vs Unchecked Exception
------------------------------
Checked
-------
Checked exception have 'throws' keyword.
The exceptions which are checked by the compiler for smooth executiuon of the program at runtime. Whether the program is handling or not.
Except runtime exceptions all other exceptions are checked exception.

FileNotFoundException
---------------------
                        import java.io.*;
                        class Test {
                            public static void main(String[] args) {
                                PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter("abc.txt");
                                pw.println("Hello");
                            }
                        }
error: unreported exception FileNotFoundException must be caught or declare to be thrown.
        at PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter("abc.txt");
Use try catch or declare throws expetion in class.

IntruptedException
------------------
                    class Test {
                        public static void main(String[] args) {
                                System.out.println("I want to sleep peacefully");
                            Thread.sleep(1000); //every java program compulsary contain 1 thread. i.e. main thread.
                        }
                    }
If main thread entered into the spleep. Java give error. Because other threads will intrupt this.
error: unreported exception IntruptedException must be caught or declare to be thrown.
        at Thread.sleep(1000);


Unchecked
---------
Exceptions which are not checked by compiler.
Rearly occured exceptions.
All errors are unchecked exception, and runtime exceptions is also unchecked exception.

ArithmeticException
-------------------
                    class Test {
                        public static void main(String[] args) {
                            System.out.println(10/0);
                        }
                    }
error: Exception in thread 'main' java.lang.AirthmeticException: /by zero
        at Test.main(Test.java.5)


Partially Checked and Fully Checked Exception
---------------------------------------------
Throwables are Partially Checked Exception.
Exceptions are partially checked, because they are checked but some of its child are unchecked.
Partial Checked are those, whose child exceptions are unchecked.
Fully Checked are those whose parent class is checked and their child exceptions are also checked.
